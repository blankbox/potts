A *QA Tester* might find an **Issue** - ``Bug is found``.

Rather than the *QA Tester* needing to determine what actions are needed - an **Event** happens, such as ***Issue Created*** and whose **Parent Issue** has the type property ***Bug***.

This can then be used to create an **Issue Set** that creates a number of actions **Actions**.

``Investigate Bug`` which is auto assigned to an **Actor** or Group of **Actors**. Depending on the needs or size of organisation - this could be auto assigned to a *Developer* or another *QA Tester* (if it needs to be repeated first).

The **Issue** itself, may start with a **State** of ``Unconfirmed`` - which may appear to both *Developers* and *QA Testers*, any of whom can attempt to repeat.

The **Issue** may then be transitioned to ``Confirmed``, whereupon it would only appear to *Developers*.
