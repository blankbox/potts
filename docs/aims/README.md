## Design Aims

Potts is designed to be used everywhere. Personal features are added to make Potts truly useful and eventually embeddable into the life of the User.

If Potts is useful to the User in their daily lives, during their free-time, adding value to their household and beyond - then the ease integration into working is improved, and thus the institutional value is increase.

### Granularity and Discreteness

Potts Effort Tracker is intended to provide discrete datums to interact with, or to cause processes to move.

**The Core User Intent: What's Next?**

An Actor doesn't need to be aware of what will happen after their work is complete, nor what needs to happen prior to their work commencing.

While comprehensive information should be rapidly accessible such as: the history of an issue, other Actors' progress, and sufficient information to anticipate future needs - this isn't a regular user intent.

#### User Intents

* Discover current task
* Find more detail about current task
* Communicate about current task
* Investigate current task history
* Investigate similar tasks
* Explore and contribute to wider effort

Each intent should be served differently.

An Actor needs:

A State of information that is complete

Permission to proceed


An Actor is responsible for:

Ensuring State is suitable for the next actor

These things can be driven by process and validation. While process and validation can be used to ensure larger objects are complete and ready for work


### Interfaces

Interfaces need to be sparse - containing only the information needed for the user intent.

#### What's now

* Things that you need to action
* Things that you need to review
* Things that you need to be aware of

#### What's next

* Things that you need to be prepared for
