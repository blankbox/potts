### Other Current Effort

A User, such as a Manager may be interested in:

* What is the Current Action of a particular Actor?

In general, the **Mechanical Turk** principle should be used to organise Effort.

Users should be able to change some properties of **State** for **Issues** or **Actions** - taking into account their understanding of context.

Quorum may be possible where needed - such as where scoring or estimates are used.

Where data provided by Users has practical and cultural value - that is, priority, scoring etc are consistent - then sensible ordering and selection of **Actions** should be a natural consequence.

That said, Potts may lack context for some decisions - and overrides may be needed. A User (with the correct role) should be able to reorganise **Actions** in such a way as to change the ordering, priority, etc of Effort for an **Actor** or **Actors**.
