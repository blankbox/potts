### Turk Pool

As **Issues** are created and **Events** happen - the need for Turk Actions to take place increases.

**Issues** and **Actions** that are awaiting Turk Actions are given to the Turk Pool.

Each User has a view of the Turk Pool that prioritises Turk Actions that are best suited to them.

Turk Actions include:

#### Actions

* Scoring an **Action**
* Delegating an **Action**
* Assigning an **Action**

#### Issues

* Creating **Actions** for **Issues**
* Prioritising an **Issue**
* Delegating an **Issue**
* Assigning an **Issue**

\# Issues can be Assigned to the Author by default, Delegated by the Author.

\# Ownership of the Issue does not affect the Assignment or Delegation of Actions within it.
