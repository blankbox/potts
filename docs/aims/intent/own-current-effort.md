### Own Current Effort

In general, a User that is an Actor - will want to satisfy the following questions:

* What is my Current Action?
* Are there any parallel Actions that I can perform - giving my choices as to how I apply my effort?
* Which Actions will I need to perform after the Current Action?
* Are there any Actions in the near future that I will benefit from being aware of?

An **Actor** should be able to work on multiple Actions in parallel. While not all **Actors** will need to do this, there are use cases where any Effort made will have the effect of completing multiple **Actions**.
