## Issue

An **Issue** is an **Object** which contains
- a set of parameters that create a [State](/docs/definitions//states.md),
- [Actions](/docs/definitions//actions.md) that need to be taken, and
- [References](/docs/definitions/references.md) that can be made.

``Design needs to be created``
``Design needs to be implemented``
``Bug is found``

When an **Issue** is found a number of **Actions** need to be taken to remedy that Issue.

An **Issue** might require a **Reference** which points to move information, evidence, or a physical location.
