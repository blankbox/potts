## Issue

An **Issue** is a set of parameters that create a [State](/docs/definitions//states.md), [Actions](/docs/definitions//actions.md) that need to be taken, and [References](/docs/definitions/references.md) that can be made.

``Bug is found``

With the example of a bug being found, a number of **Actions** are needed to remedy.
