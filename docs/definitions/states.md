## State

A **State** is a collection of parameters for an object that can be *Listened* to. Some parameters do not *Trigger* **Events** - such as references.

Creating or updating a **Reference** for an **Issue** does not *Trigger* an **Object Event** or a **Service Event**.

Those changes that are not listenable, do leave log traces.
